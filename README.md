# MiM2

A much cleaner spiritual successor to [Casper7526's `mim`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYVmooRe4n0).

Under heavy development.  Please report bugs!

I recommend using CraftOS-PC _Accelerated_ or disabling lighting for best results.  The lighting engine _should_ be fast enough to be usable even in-game, though, and definitely on standard CraftOS-PC.  The most noticeable difference is in map save/load times.

Maps are 1.5 to 2 MB, so you'll need to increase the computer space limit in CC:T's configuration for full functionality.

# Running

Install `mim2.lua` on a computer in-game.  For text output to be fully usable you'll need to copy the included `startup.lua` to the computer also.

# Font installation

Use the resource pack under `resourcepack` in this repository, or point CraftOS-PC's `customFontPath` setting to `mim2_font.bmp`.
