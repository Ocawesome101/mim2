# MiM2

A much cleaner spiritual successor to Casper7526's `mim`.

I recommend using CraftOS-PC _Accelerated_ or disabling lighting for best results.

# Running

Run `craftos -d /path/to/this/repo`, or install `mim2.lua` on a computer in-game.

# Font installation

A resource pack will be provided in the future.
